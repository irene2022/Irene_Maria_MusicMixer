# The Sounds of the Body: Music Mixer Project

## Autors:
Irene Mary Vinu and Maria Lopera

## Description:
This is a Music Mixer project based on the Sounds of The Body. The main idea of the Music Mixer is to create music with the Sounds of the Body. If you play the sound of different parts of the Human Body it is posible to create interesting and creative music.
In The Sounds of the Body Music Mixer, you should pick the part of the body you want to play and drag them from the Icon-parts zone and then drop them in the female body figure on the right side. Once the icon is dropped, you will give it play and the body parts will start to sound.

## Project Status
We have created some icons but after this checkpoint the idea  is  to redesign them better and create new ones (voice, ears, throat, hands,...)
